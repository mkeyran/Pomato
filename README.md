#### Current features:

- System tray icon which display remaining time and allow control
- Notifications (text and sound)
- Ticking while pomodoro is active
- Simple GUI
- Settings (Duration of pomodoro, short and long breaks, auto-continue mode and whether pauses are allowed).

#### Planned features:
    
- Global hotkeys
- Some kind of statistics
- Visual styles
- Tasks
- Integration with the todo.txt system (some day)
